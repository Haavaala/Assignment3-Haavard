2. when the user presses the update/edit button/icon, a text field should be made available to the
user, underneath the list where the user can enter the new content for the respective item.

I didnt make a new text field for this one. Im using the same one. If there are many items added, then the new text field would have been place at the bottom of the list. 


the items that are on the page when opening has some issues: the edit button, when it is pressed, the confirm and cancel buttons appear on the top item every time. it wont let the user edit the text either. the cancel button removes both buttons as it should but the newly added text wont disappear. the confirm button works fine. the remove button also works perfectly fine.

everything else works fine. the adding of new items and editing/removing them. the clear button and add button also works fine. so the only problem is the edit button on the already existing items.

worst case option is to remove the already existing items since that button works, and then add a new activity with the same text for example.

I also know that the way I have done things is not the best or most efficient way. but I understand what I have done compared to not understanding a code from another place.
