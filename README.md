git repo for my 3rd assingment in IDG1011:


inspiration for my todo list:


2. when the user presses the update/edit button/icon, a text field should be made available to the
user, underneath the list where the user can enter the new content for the respective item.

I didnt make a new text field for this one. Im using the same one. If there are many items added, then the new text field would have been place at the bottom of the list.
